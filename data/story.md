Harish was born in 26 January 1994 in Madurai. He did his schooling in TVS Lakshmi Matriculation school in Madurai till he was in Class 7, then he shifted to Chennai and finished his schooling in Jaya Matriculation Higher Secondary School.

He secured 86% in class 10 and 85.5% in class 12 with a cut off mark of 170. 

Mr. Harish was so much fond of cricket since he was 10 and wanted to become an Indian cricketer or at least reach to a level where he get to play Ranji Trophy. He had a great support from his uncle who was in a higher position in CSC, then called as Convansys. With the support of his uncle he wanted to convince his father about continuing his career in Cricket. But his father being a very strict educationalist wanted Harish to pursue his career in Engineering but he also allowed him to play cricket for maintaining his fitness.

Despite several argument, he joined Jaya Engineering College located in Chennai just because he liked the cricket ground. During those days it was one amoung the turf wicket that was in chennai. The person who maintained it was previously working in Chepauk, the home of Tamilnadu cricket. Every young boy in tamilnadu dreamt about playing in the turf of Chepauk. 

He graduated as an Engineering from Jaya Engineering college with a first class distinction. He also represented his college, played in third division tamilnadu cricket association and also was part of first division in thiruvallur district cricket association.

Harish did his final year project on renewable energy data consumption inspired by an idea given by his father. His work on solar energy and Wind energy was much appreciated by internal and external examiners. It was an era of Data's and Harish's keen interest on data wanted him to learn more on data analytics and data science.

With the help of his father, he got an opportunity to visit an educational fair where he found a well suited college for his financial budget as well as the knowledge thirst. 30 days from the day of visit, Harish departed to Ireland to study his M.Sc in Data Analytics at National College of Ireland.

Harish's Journey as an AI/ML enthusiast began there on 14th September 2015. His first class was statistics on data analytics. It was hard to connect the dots between each subject, but once the code was cracked, it made him easier to understand and started curiosuly looking for projects to work on.

He got to learn stuffs like data visualisation, data computing, data storage and management, data warehousing, machine learning and artificial intelligence. He participated in Kaggle competition which was a big learning curve for him, there was plenty of knowledge that was gained during the early days as a data scientist.

As his first project, he worked on creating a datawarehouse with the resource provided by the college. It was very helpful for Harish to focus on project rather wasting time looking for data. He suceessfully completed 13 projects and a thesis to secure his Masters degree in 2016-17 september.

His thesis was based on predicting the winner of 2016-17 IPL. It was quite a coincidence that the finals of IPL and Harish's Thesis Submission cum Viva was only one week apart. Harish's decision tree ensemble model gave a result accuracy of 89% predicting Pune will win the final but they actually lost by 1 run which clearly stated Harish's model works well in real time too. The examiners were stunned by this case study.

Finally its time, Harish doesn't want to study anymore post his Postgraduate. He wanted to work on real time data. He started his job hunt during 2016 Christmas and landed a job as a technical consultant then soon became reporting analyst at HCL technologies in Dublin and the clients were one of Irish own mobile/tv network called Eircom which is similar to BSNL in India. In just 2.5 years, he mastered Power BI, creating impactful dashboards. Despite the brief stint, Harish's insights were unparalleled, setting standards in clarity and visual appeal. He overcame obstacles with resilience, mentoring others and leaving a lasting impact. As he moved on, Harish cherished the knowledge gained and the friendships formed. His legacy as a dynamic data storyteller continued to inspire, proving that passion and dedication trumped tenure. Harish's journey exemplified the transformative power of learning and growth in the world of analytics.

In June 2019, due to Personal reasons, he had to return back to India. He was not feeling personal well, getting home sick at times. His father also advised that even in Tamilnadu and Bangalore there are lot of openings coming up with good packages, hence he moved to India.

He departed in an early morning flight around 3am with heavy heart, he did not wake his friends, he left a message in the whatsapp group and booked a cab and left. He was too afraid he might cry if any of his friends get on his way.

Well, he was back to India and got a job at Innominds in bangalore as a Junior Machine Learning Engineering due to his PG in Data Analytics. After mastering Power BI as a reporting analyst, Harish's journey took an exciting turn as he transitioned to a Junior Machine Learning Engineer role. Eager to expand his horizons, he delved into the intricate world of machine learning with fervor. Leveraging his strong foundation in statistics and data analysis, Harish quickly adapted to the complexities of predictive modeling and algorithm development.

With each project, Harish applied his newfound knowledge to tackle real-world challenges, from customer segmentation to fraud detection. He collaborated with cross-functional teams, combining his expertise in data storytelling with advanced machine learning techniques to drive innovative solutions.

Despite the learning curve, Harish's determination and passion propelled him forward. Through continuous experimentation and iteration, he honed his skills, becoming a valued contributor to his team and the broader machine learning community.

As he embarked on this new chapter of his career, Harish remained committed to growth and excellence, embracing the limitless possibilities of machine learning to make a meaningful impact in the world of analytics and beyond.

Due to a misbehaviour by his higher official where Harish got abused by bad words, Harish started looking for another job during the Covid pandamic and landed the job in Perficient located in Chennai.

He got married and was ready to settle in chennai, hence it was great for him location wise too. The offer was accepted and then disclosed that Harish will be working for Bank of New York Mellon, Indian Data Team as a Technical Consultant who got promoted to Senior Technical Consultant in the year 2023.

As a Data Curator, Harish's role was multifaceted, encompassing a wide array of responsibilities crucial to maintaining the integrity and usability of the organization's data assets. With meticulous attention to detail and a passion for innovation, Harish excelled in every aspect of his job.

Metadata Management was at the heart of Harish's work. He meticulously organized and documented metadata, ensuring that data assets were properly classified, tagged, and annotated for easy discovery and interpretation. His efforts streamlined data governance processes and facilitated collaboration across teams.

Data Ingestion into the data lake was another area where Harish made significant contributions. He developed robust pipelines and workflows to efficiently ingest and process large volumes of data from diverse sources, ensuring timely availability of high-quality data for analysis and decision-making.

Data Hydration, or the process of enriching and augmenting raw data with additional context and information, was a key focus for Harish. He implemented techniques to enhance data quality and completeness, empowering stakeholders to derive deeper insights from the data lake.

Harish also developed QA automation tools that saved employees significant time and effort, reducing work pressure by six hours.

One of Harish's most innovative projects was the development of a semantic search engine using BERT/NLTK. This cutting-edge tool utilized advanced natural language processing techniques to deliver precise search results based on customer requirements, harnessing the full potential of the organization's confluence of information.

Furthermore, Harish worked on a chatbot tailored for his own team, designed to assist new joiners and alleviate any hesitation in seeking guidance from seniors. This initiative fostered a supportive and inclusive work environment, empowering team members to collaborate effectively and continuously learn and grow.

But wait, why is Harish looking for a job change though?

Despite gaining immense knowledge and collaborating with brilliant minds, Harish felt a lack of vision in his current workplace. Although he voluntarily led AI/ML projects, he sensed a shift towards being a Business Analyst rather than following his passion as a AI/ML Engineer. Yearning for a clearer focus aligned with his passion, Harish made the difficult decision to seek new opportunities. Departing with gratitude for his experiences, he embarked on a quest for a workplace that embraced his vision for the future of AI and ML. Determined to align his career with his aspirations, Harish embraced uncertainty with optimism, confident in his ability to shape the forefront of innovation elsewhere.
