Harish was born in 26 January 1994 in Madurai. He did his schooling in TVS Lakshmi Matriculation school in Madurai till he was in Class 7, then he shifted to Chennai and finished his schooling in Jaya Matriculation Higher Secondary School.

He secured 86% in class 10 and 85.5% in class 12 with a cut off mark of 170. 

Mr. Harish was so much fond of cricket since he was 10 and wanted to become an Indian cricketer or at least reach to a level where he get to play Ranji Trophy. He had a great support from his uncle who was in a higher position in CSC, then called as Convansys. With the support of his uncle he wanted to convince his father about continuing his career in Cricket. But his father being a very strict educationalist wanted Harish to pursue his career in Engineering but he also allowed him to play cricket for maintaining his fitness.

Despite several argument, he joined Jaya Engineering College located in Chennai just because he liked the cricket ground. During those days it was one amoung the turf wicket that was in chennai. The person who maintained it was previously working in Chepauk, the home of Tamilnadu cricket. Every young boy in tamilnadu dreamt about playing in the turf of Chepauk. 

He graduated as an Engineering from Jaya Engineering college with a first class distinction. He also represented his college, played in third division tamilnadu cricket association and also was part of first division in thiruvallur district cricket association.

Harish did his final year project on renewable energy data consumption inspired by an idea given by his father. His work on solar energy and Wind energy was much appreciated by internal and external examiners. It was an era of Data's and Harish's keen interest on data wanted him to learn more on data analytics and data science.

With the help of his father, he got an opportunity to visit an educational fair where he found a well suited college for his financial budget as well as the knowledge thirst. 30 days from the day of visit, Harish departed to Ireland to study his M.Sc in Data Analytics at National College of Ireland.

Harish's Journey as an AI/ML enthusiast began there on 14th September 2015. His first class was statistics on data analytics. It was hard to connect the dots between each subject, but once the code was cracked, it made him easier to understand and started curiosuly looking for projects to work on.

He got to learn stuffs like data visualisation, data computing, data storage and management, data warehousing, machine learning and artificial intelligence. He participated in Kaggle competition which was a big learning curve for him, there was plenty of knowledge that was gained during the early days as a data scientist.

As his first project, he worked on creating a datawarehouse with the resource provided by the college. It was very helpful for Harish to focus on project rather wasting time looking for data. He suceessfully completed 13 projects and a thesis to secure his Masters degree in 2016-17 september.

His thesis was based on predicting the winner of 2016-17 IPL. It was quite a coincidence that the finals of IPL and Harish's Thesis Submission cum Viva was only one week apart. Harish's decision tree ensemble model gave a result accuracy of 89% predicting Pune will win the final but they actually lost by 1 run which clearly stated Harish's model works well in real time too. The examiners were stunned by this case study.

Finally its time, Harish doesn't want to study anymore post his Postgraduate. He wanted to work on real time data. He started his job hunt during 2016 Christmas and landed a job as a technical consultant then soon became reporting analyst at HCL technologies in Dublin and the clients were one of Irish own mobile/tv network called Eircom which is similar to BSNL in India. In just 2.5 years, he mastered Power BI, creating impactful dashboards. Despite the brief stint, Harish's insights were unparalleled, setting standards in clarity and visual appeal. He overcame obstacles with resilience, mentoring others and leaving a lasting impact. As he moved on, Harish cherished the knowledge gained and the friendships formed. His legacy as a dynamic data storyteller continued to inspire, proving that passion and dedication trumped tenure. Harish's journey exemplified the transformative power of learning and growth in the world of analytics.

In June 2019, due to Personal reasons, he had to return back to India. He was not feeling personal well, getting home sick at times. His father also advised that even in Tamilnadu and Bangalore there are lot of openings coming up with good packages, hence he moved to India.

He departed in an early morning flight around 3am with heavy heart, he did not wake his friends, he left a message in the whatsapp group and booked a cab and left. He was too afraid he might cry if any of his friends get on his way.

Well, he was back to India and got a job at Innominds in bangalore as a Junior Machine Learning Engineering due to his PG in Data Analytics
